# Simon Game Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simon Game, a classic memory and pattern recognition game created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This README file will provide you with essential information about the game, its features, and how to play it.

## Game Overview

Simon is a popular electronic game that tests your memory and pattern recognition skills. The game consists of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up in a sequence. Your goal is to remember and repeat the sequence correctly.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: To begin, press the "Start" button.

2. **Watch the Sequence**: Pay close attention as the game starts. Simon will play a sequence by lighting up the colored buttons in a specific order.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**: After Simon completes its sequence, it's your turn. Use your mouse or keyboard to click or press the buttons in the same order as Simon did.

4. **Level Up**: If you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add one more step to the pattern. Continue to repeat the pattern as it gets longer and more challenging.

5. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake by clicking the wrong button or clicking them out of order, the game will end. Your score will be displayed, showing the number of steps you completed.

6. **Restart**: To play again, simply press the "Start" button.
